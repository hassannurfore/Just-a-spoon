  <h1>Just a Spoon</h1>

  <p>You know what makes <span class="highlight">Just a Spoon</span> good?<br>
  It knows what it is.<br>
  It doesn’t pretend to be the future of cutlery.<br>
  It doesn’t promise ergonomic grip.<br>
  It doesn’t need a dishwasher-safe guarantee.<br>
  It needs a drawer, a mouth, and someone unhinged enough to say,<br>
  “Yeah, I’ll eat soup with this for the rest of my life.”</p>

  <p>Your last utensil had more features than a Swiss Army knife.<br>
  Ours has three words: <span class="highlight">Scoop. Slurp. Regret.</span></p>

  <p>No forks.<br>
  No chopsticks.<br>
  No sporks trying to be everything at once.</p>

  <p>Just vibes, stainless steel, and the looming realization that opposable thumbs were evolution’s peak.</p>

  <p>This is <span class="highlight">Just a Spoon.</span><br>
  It’s not a product. It’s a performance art piece about late-stage utensil culture.<br>
  You don’t <em>use</em> this.<br>
  You participate in it. Like a flash mob. Or a food fight.</p>

  <p><strong>You want specs? Here they are:</strong><br>
  - Length: who cares<br>
  - Material: maybe metal, maybe plastic<br>
  - Dishwasher safe: fleeting<br>
  - Manufacturer? Maybe<br>
  - Purpose: none</p>

  <p>This spoon works everywhere. Your cereal. Your soup. Your ice cream at 2 a.m.<br>
  It’s so stupid, even your uncle who eats with his hands could use it.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">Just a Spoon</span> doesn’t solve problems.<br>
  It <strong>is</strong> the problem.</p>

  <p>You’re not early.<br>
  You’re not late.<br>
  You’re just hungry.<br>
  And sometimes, that’s enough.</p>

  <p>So stop pretending. Stop researching. Stop asking questions like you’re gonna find the perfect cutlery set on Wirecutter.</p>

  <p>You want serious? Go read a cookbook.<br>
  You want to be a part of something so hilariously dumb it might work?</p>

  <p>Welcome to <span class="highlight">Just a Spoon.</span><br>
  The last utensil you’ll ever need — because after this, you’re probably eating with your hands.</p>
